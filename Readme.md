# Trello plugin all-in-one Chrome extension

Tired of having too many Chrome extensions for Trello? Add the missing Trello features in ONE Chrome extension

## Features

### True age for the Trello card

Trello has a card aging feature, but it does not show the true age of the card in a list. When you add a comment or update the card name, the card will be treated as new.
The feature can tell you how long the card has been in the list. No excuse any more!

### Card number

Display the missing Trello card number.

### Card count for each column

Display the card count at top of the columns.

### Label name

Display the label names and still keep the color of them.

## Know issues:

1. Card age label does not show when switching boards.
2. Card age label disappears when moving cards to another list.

Just refresh the page, it will work as expected.
