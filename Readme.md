# Truello

True card age for trello.

## What is Truello

Trello has a card aging feature, but it does not show the true age of the card in a list. When you add a comment or update the card name, the card will be treated as new.
Truello can tell you how long the card has been in the list. No excuse any more!

## Know issues:

1. Card age label does not show when switching boards
2. Card age label disappears when moving cards to another list

Just refresh the page, it will work as expected.
